## Development

### Architecture

Guru-GPT API is built using hexagonal architecture, which allows us to keep our core logic decoupled from external services and databases. This architecture makes our application more maintainable and scalable.

### Database

We use PostgreSQL as our database. The schema and initial setup are managed using Docker, making it easy to start the development environment with consistent database configuration.
